Simple Ract Native + NodeJS Social Application

## Basic Idea
Nothing new here, is another facebook / instagram clone, but is made by me, so is the best. 
Is a dummy project to take confidence with the new tech stack. 

Idea is to make the social network working on microservices using NodeJs + React Native
