Simple Ract Native + NodeJS Social Application

#Basic Idea
Nothing new here, is another facebook / instagram clone, but is made by me, so I like it. 
Is a dummy project to take confidence with the new tech stack. 

Idea is to make the social network working on microservices using NodeJs + React Native

Project Started on 06-03-2022

I'm also working a full time job, so have mercy if I'm slow with it
